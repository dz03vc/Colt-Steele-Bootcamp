Repository created to record and track my progress during Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2.0;
Enrollment started on May 16th 2024;
Trying to study at least 6 hours a day;
I'll work this on at a slow pace so I can get a steady foundation and explore deeply all the sections and also the parallel contents that may appear during the bootcamp.
By the way, I'll be studying from Braganca Paulista - Sao Paulo - Brazil.
