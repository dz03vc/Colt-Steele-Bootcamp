    <h1>Colt Steele Chickens</h1>

    <p>The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
        others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>
    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore">folklore</a>,

    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <h4>Phylogeny</h4>
    <p>Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens
        belong to, survived the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their
        dinosaur relatives.[41] Chickens are descended primarily from the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl#/media/File:Red_jungle_fowl.png">red junglefowl</a>
        (Gallus gallus) and are
        scientifically classified as the same species.[42] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of
        red junglefowl.[42] The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl
        and green junglefowl;[43] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the
        grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[44] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with
        red junglefowl.[43]</p>
    <h4>Domestication</h4>
    <p>According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave
        rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[47] The red junglefowl is well
        adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo
        seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[48] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red
        junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[49]</p>
